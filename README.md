# Locker

Locker is a secure, private media vault application built with Flutter for Android. It provides a safe space to hide and protect your sensitive photos, videos, and documents from prying eyes, with multiple layers of security including biometric authentication, optional AES-256 encryption, and an auto-kill feature that removes the app from the recent apps list when you leave.

## Security

### Authentication Methods

Locker supports three authentication methods:

1. **PIN**: A 6-digit numeric PIN
2. **Password**: An alphanumeric password of any length
3. **Biometrics**: Fingerprint or face recognition (requires PIN or password as backup)

### Encryption

When enabled, files are encrypted using AES-256 encryption:

- **Small files**: AES-256-CBC mode with in-memory processing
- **Large files**: AES-256-CTR mode with streaming encryption for memory efficiency

Encryption is disabled by default for performance reasons. Enable it in Settings for maximum security.

### Auto-Kill Feature

The auto-kill feature ensures the app is removed from the Android recent apps switcher when:

- The user presses the home button
- The user switches to another app
- The app goes into the background

This prevents others from seeing that the app was recently used.

### Decoy Mode

Decoy mode allows you to set up a fake vault with a different PIN. If someone forces you to unlock the app, enter the decoy PIN to show the fake vault instead of your real hidden files.
